## Getting Started

### 1. Supabase Setup

1. Create a project at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
2. Run the migration file in the Supabase SQL editor:
   ```
   supabase/migrations/001_initial_schema.sql
   ```
3. Create two Storage buckets in Supabase:
   - `symptom-media` (public)
   - `medical-docs` (public)

### 2. Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
cp .env.example .env.local
# Fill in your Supabase URL and anon key
npm install
npm run dev
```

### 3. Backend

```bash
cd backend
cp .env.example .env
# Fill in your Supabase URL and service role key
npm install
npm run dev
```

The frontend runs on `http://localhost:5173` and the backend on `http://localhost:3001`.

## Database Schema

See [`supabase/migrations/001_initial_schema.sql`](supabase/migrations/001_initial_schema.sql) for the full schema.

Key tables:
- `profiles` – Extends Supabase Auth users with role (patient/doctor), bio, health info
- `symptom_reports` – Stores structured pre-appointment reports with photos/video URLs
- `appointments` – Tracks appointment lifecycle (requested → confirmed → done)
- `medical_records` – Prescription data and medical history per appointment
- `doctor_ratings` – Post-appointment doctor ratings
- `forum_posts` / `forum_comments` – Community forum content

## Doctor Type Suggestion

The app uses keyword-based rule matching to suggest the most appropriate type of doctor (e.g., Cardiologist, Dermatologist, Neurologist). This is designed to be swappable with an AI/LLM backend call.
